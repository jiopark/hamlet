		<p>This website is a mock-up for a restaurant called "The Potter's Field," based on the play Hamlet by Shakespeare. The name 'The Potter's Field' means a common man's grave and refers to the unceremonious grave for Ophelia, a pivotal scene in the play itself. If the restaurant is the body of the play then the players are the courses in the menu. I designed a menu where characters were represented by a dish, by ingredients, preparations and arranagement.<br><br>I wanted to do a a restaurant and menu as my setting for a character study because in Hamlet, death comes to those who consume the poison planted by various characters. Consumption is an interesting subject so I wanted to expand on that, including the consumption of greed, sin and power.</p>
