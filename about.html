		<p>This website is a mock-up for a restaurant called "The Potter's Field," based on the play Hamlet by Shakespeare. The dishes served by the restaurants are character studies. The name 'The Potter's Field' means a common man's grave and refers to the unceremonious grave for Ophelia, a pivotal scene in the play itself. If the restaurant is the body of the play then the players are the courses in the menu. Each character and their actions are deliberated in a course. Each course is made up of different ingredients, arrangements and preparation styles that all add to the character analysis.<br><br>I wanted to do a restaurant and menu as my setting for a character study because in Hamlet, death comes to Gertrude who consumes the poison. I wanted to expand on the act of consumption. In Hamlet, Gertrude consumes the poison and dies so my analysis is the reverse: consuming in order to live. Please enjoy the menu.</p>
		<p>Tools & Skills I used include: Photography, Photoshop, Amateur cooking, web design and web development in HTML/CSS. This project took a little over a month. I started with menu planning, then preparing and arranging the food. Additionally working in Photoshop to retouch the images and move them to my website. All images have been produced by me, aside from the background which is an open-source images I modified to add in my own logo. </p>
